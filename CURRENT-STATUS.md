# Current Implementation Status - Emergency Dispatch Game

*Last Updated: December 12, 2025*

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### Core Game Systems
- **User Authentication & Onboarding**: Complete Supabase Auth integration with German localization
- **City Selection**: OpenStreetMap Nominatim API integration for realistic German city selection
- **Map Integration**: Leaflet.js with CartoDB Dark Matter tiles, SSR-compatible implementation
- **Station Management**: Full CRUD operations for fire/EMS stations with real German blueprint data

### Vehicle Systems
- **Fleet Management**: 12 realistic German vehicle types (LF 10, RTW, etc.)
- **FMS Status Integration**: Complete German Funkmeldesystem (1-9) implementation
- **Vehicle Dispatch**: Professional dispatch interface with distance calculation via OSRM
- **Animation System**: Real-time vehicle movement at 70 km/h using actual road routes
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time vehicle status updates via Supabase subscriptions

### Mission Systems  
- **Mission Generation**: Realistic location-based missions using OpenStreetMap data
- **Location Verification**: Advanced filtering with Overpass API (water body exclusion, road accessibility)
- **Visual Indicators**: Status-based mission markers with smooth animations
- **Multi-Vehicle Dispatch**: Support for dispatching multiple vehicles to single missions
- **Dynamic Mission Management**: Real-time updates, recall functionality, additional dispatching

### Critical Fixes (December 2025)
- **üö® Vehicle Recall Bug**: Fixed critical issue where multiple recalled vehicles remained stuck in missions
- **üîß TypeScript Compilation**: Resolved all compilation errors for production builds
- **üõ†Ô∏è Stuck Vehicle Recovery**: Added manual repair system with red wrench button

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
- **9 Migrations**: Complete schema with RLS policies
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live vehicle status, mission updates  
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interface definitions
- **Multi-tenant Security**: Row-level security for user isolation

### Frontend (Next.js 15 + React 19)
- **App Router**: Modern Next.js architecture
- **SSR Optimization**: Dynamic imports for Leaflet components
- **Real-time UI**: Live status updates without page reloads
- **German Localization**: Complete interface in German
- **Dark Mode Design**: Professional dark theme with emergency service colors

### Performance & Reliability
- **OSRM Integration**: Real road-based distance calculations
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper API usage management
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Animation Performance**: 60fps vehicle animations with distance-based timing

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
- **Lint Warnings**: Non-critical ESLint warnings (unused variables, image optimization suggestions)
- **Dev Server**: Use `npx next dev` instead of `npm run dev` due to Turbopack RSC conflicts

### Missing Features (Next Phase)
- **Mission Completion**: No automatic completion or rewards system
- **Economics**: No operational costs, revenue, or financial management
- **Progression**: No station/vehicle upgrades or experience systems  
- **Analytics**: No performance metrics or statistics tracking
- **Multiplayer**: No cross-player interactions or leaderboards

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Mission Completion System
1. Implement automatic mission completion after configurable durations
2. Design reward calculation algorithm based on response time and vehicle types
3. Add mission completion UI and feedback systems

### Priority 2: Basic Economics  
1. Add daily operational costs for vehicles and stations
2. Implement revenue from completed missions
3. Create basic financial dashboard and balance tracking

### Priority 3: Quality of Life
1. Add mission filtering and search capabilities
2. Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
3. Add audio notifications for important events

## üèÜ Achievement Unlocked
