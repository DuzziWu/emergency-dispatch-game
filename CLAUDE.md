# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Emergency Dispatch Game (Leitstellenspiel NextGen) - A modern browser-based emergency dispatch simulation game where players manage fire and EMS stations, purchase vehicles, and respond to automatically generated incidents on real maps using actual road networks.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server with Turbopack (recommended)
npm run dev

# Build for production with Turbopack
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Run linter (ESLint with Next.js configuration)
npm run lint

# TypeScript type checking (manual)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Supabase local development
supabase start           # Start local Supabase stack
supabase stop            # Stop local Supabase stack
supabase status          # Check status of local services
supabase db reset        # Reset database with migrations and seed data
supabase studio          # Open Supabase Studio (localhost:54323)
```

**Development URLs:**
- Next.js app: http://localhost:3000
- Supabase Studio: http://localhost:54323
- Supabase API: http://127.0.0.1:54321

## Technology Stack & Architecture

**Frontend Framework:**
- Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router and TypeScript
- React 19.1.0 with strict mode
- Client-side components with SSR optimizations via dynamic imports

**Styling & UI:**
- TailwindCSS v4 with dark-mode-first design
- Custom color palette for emergency services (fire=red, EMS=orange, warnings=yellow)
- Fully German-localized interface with icon-based navigation
- **Lucide React icon library** for consistent, professional icons throughout the UI
- Responsive overlay UI over fullscreen map

**Maps & Geolocation:**
- Leaflet.js with CartoDB Dark Matter tiles for dark theme
- Dynamic imports for SSR compatibility (`Map.tsx` uses `'use client'`)
- Future: OSRM or Mapbox Directions API for real route calculations
- Future: OpenStreetMap/Overpass API for realistic incident location generation

**Backend (Implemented):**
- Supabase for PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time subscriptions ✅

```

**Core Components:**
- `GameLayout.tsx`: Main game interface with German localization, credits display, action buttons, and mission panel
- `Map.tsx`: Leaflet wrapper with dynamic loading for SSR compatibility
- Database types follow the complete schema specification from `specs.md`

## Database Schema (Supabase PostgreSQL)

All tables defined as TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/database.ts`:

**Core Tables (Created & Configured):**
- `profiles`: User data with home city coordinates and credits ✅
- `stations`: Player-built fire/EMS stations with levels and extensions ✅
- `vehicles`: Fleet management with real-time status tracking ✅
- `missions`: Generated incidents with realistic locations and outcomes ✅
- `station_blueprints`: Template stations from real-world data ✅
- `vehicle_types`: 12 realistic German vehicles loaded (LF 10, RTW, etc.) ✅
- `mission_types`: Incident templates with probability outcomes ✅

**Key Design Principles:**
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions for multiplayer experience
- Server-side mission generation using actual OpenStreetMap data
- Vehicle routing uses actual road distances, not air distance
- All game logic runs server-side for security and consistency

## Key Implementation Guidelines

**When working with this codebase:**

1. **Map Components**: Always use dynamic imports for Leaflet components to avoid SSR hydration issues
2. **Real-time Features**: All live updates must flow through Supabase subscriptions, not polling
3. **Game Logic**: Critical calculations (payouts, mission outcomes) run server-side in Edge Functions
4. **Localization**: Maintain German language throughout the interface
5. **UI Philosophy**: Keep interface minimal, map-centric, with icon-based controls
6. **Routing**: Must use actual road networks, never air-distance calculations
7. **Performance**: Use Turbopack for development and builds (`--turbopack` flag)

**Code Style:**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Components should be client-side (`'use client'`) only when necessary
- Maintain dark-mode-first design principles
- ESLint configuration uses Next.js Core Web Vitals + TypeScript rules
- Custom color palette: fire (#ef4444), EMS (#f97316), missions (#fbbf24)
- **Use Lucide React icons consistently** - no custom SVGs or emojis
- **Modular component architecture** - break large components into smaller, focused modules

**Database Considerations:**
- All tables follow the detailed schema in `specs.md`
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data isolation
- Real-time subscriptions filtered by `user_id`
- Mission generation must use actual geographic data from OpenStreetMap
